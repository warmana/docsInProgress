<p>The MOJ provides the IT equipment you need for your work. But you might prefer to use your own smartphone, laptop, tablet, or PC. It can even be cheaper for the MOJ.</p>
<p>Using your own device is often acceptable as long as you take some precautions first. Remember that you are responsible for the MOJ information held on, or accessed by, your device. It might be your equipment, but you have the same obligations and responsibilities for protecting MOJ information and resources.</p>
<p>You must always:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ensure your equipment meets and maintains MOJ IT security standards, and be ready to demonstrate this at any time</li>
  <li>maintain the corporate 'memory'. This means being able to respond fully to Freedom of Information or Data Protection Act requests</li>
  <li>be able to show a specific business benefit for using your own device</li>
  <li>be clear as to what work you can, or cannot do, on your equipment</li>
</ul>

<h2>Before you start using your device</h2>

<h3>Check with your line manager</h3>
<p>If you want to work using your own equipment, ask your line manager for permission first, so you can discuss any issues.</p>
<p>Be clear about what tools you will use, and the tasks you will perform: if it's not discussed, it's not approved.</p>

<h3>Make sure your device is secure</h3>
<p>To stop other people accessing MOJ systems or information, your device must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ask for a <a href="https://www.cyberaware.gov.uk/passwords" target="_blank">strong password</a>, PIN, fingerprint or other ID verification whenever you log on</li>
  <li>lock the screen if you don’t use it for 10 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure that your device is completely up-to-date with security patches and antivirus/anti-malware tools.</p>
<p>Remember that some devices have automatic and continuous backup tools installed; these might grab and store sensitive MOJ information.</p>

<h2>When using your device</h2>

<h3>Keep your security up to date</h3>
<p>Always install the <a href="https://www.cyberaware.gov.uk/software-updates" target="_blank">latest security updates</a> as soon as they are available, to help keep your device secure.</p>

<h3>Avoid storing work files or information on your device</h3>
<p>Make sure everything is stored and up-to-date within the MOJ approved services you’re using. If you are working with MOJ G-Suite (Google Apps), or MOJ Office 365, the information must stay in those systems, not somewhere else on your device.</p>
<p>If you really must store information on the device, for example because you are remote working and have no network access, delete the information from the device as soon as possible, after you have finished.</p>
<p>Be especially careful of backup tools on the device, which might store data and therefore stop you complying with data protection requirements.</p>

<h3>Be careful when sharing the device</h3>
<p>If a family member borrows your tablet or laptop (for example), make sure they cannot use the MOJ applications, or access any of the work information.</p>

<h2>If something goes wrong</h2>
<p>If your device is lost, stolen or 'hacked', you must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>tell your line manager straight away</li>
  <li>fill in a <a href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/report-a-security-incident/">security incident form</a></li>
  <li>email the form to: <mailto:itservicedesk@justice.gsi.gov.uk></li>
</ul>

<h2>Services you can use on your own devices</h2>
<p>In general, sensitive information can only be accessed, used or shared on approved services. Remember that the sensitive information might include personal data.</p>
<p>Guidance on classifying information is available <a href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/knowledge-information/protecting-information/classifying-information/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Only information classified as <code>OFFICIAL</code> or <code>OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE</code> can be used on your device.</p>
<p>If you are not sure whether the information is sensitive, assume that it is sensitive.</p>

<h3>These services are approved for working with sensitive information</h3>
<ul>
  <li>MOJ's GSuite (formerly Google apps) service. You have access to this if your work email address ends in "<code>@digital.justice.gov.uk</code>"</li>
  <li>MOJ's Office 365 service. You have access to this if your work email address ends with "<code>@justice.gov.uk</code>"</li>
