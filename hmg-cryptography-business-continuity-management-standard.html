All HMG encryption is procured from CESG which is the National Technical Authority for Information Assurance and is based in GCHQ.  It is typically produced to support a CAPS product which means that it has gone through rigorous testing to give HMG assurance that it is secure.  HMG Cryptography is produced under special circumstances to provide additional assurance and that process, distribution and storage of this material is protected and secure.

HMG has specific standards on the management of Crypto and other associated products called the HMG IS4, it is the policy of the MoJ to follow and comply with HMG IS4 and this document is intended to support and augment that standard.
 
##Encryption Media
###Types of encryption and how they are distributed
Key Variables are typically loaded onto Floppy discs, or CD.
####Hard disc encryption
Products such as Becrypt, Eclypt and Bitlocker are procured and distributed to by suppliers through the MoJ Crypto Custodian and transferred to them to deploy and manage for the lifetime of the key variable which is determined by the CESG Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs).

####Transmission encryption
Products such as XKryptor, Datacryptor and Ultra AEP are procured and managed by the MoJ Crypto Custodian and distributed to suppliers as and when necessary and returned to the MoJ Crypto Custodian for storage.

##Segregation and supersession
Key variables that are issued from CESG are typically issued with two editions.  The first is for immediate deployment and the second is for emergency supersession.  In the case of hard disc encryption the supplier holds the live edition and the MoJ Crypto Custodian holds any others.  All supplier crypto deployment environments are not at the same site as the MoJ Crypto Custodian and this provides natural segregation of the editions.

Eclypt uses a lifetime key variable and does not have more than one edition, In the event of compromise, the usual CINRAS report and request to CESG for emergency replacement of the key variable will be required.
 
 
##Protection of Key Variables
All encryption is stored in a CPNI Class 4 safe which also has a certified 2 hour burning time.  Above the safe is a fire suppressant sprinkler system.

Access to the safe is strictly limited to the MoJ Crypto Custodian and the Alternate Crypto Custodian.  A copy of the master code for the safe is stored with the Departmental Security Officer.  Only the DSO or ITSO are permitted to open the safe in the event of an emergency.

###Work ethic with key variables
The area that the MoJ Custodian works is open plan in an accredited IL3 environment.  The DSO has further accredited the immediate area surrounding the MoJ Crypto Custodian in 5.31 of 102 Petty France for Crypto Management on the understanding that the personnel surrounding him are SC cleared and because there are desks immediately by the safe to allow a clear line of site from the Custodianâ€™s desk to the safe.

All key variables must be kept in the safe and only removed when specific action is required on a key variable.
 
 
##Emergency procedures for evacuation and invacuation
Applicable to anyone who has access to any of the safes:

	

1.   if the alarms sound return all encryption that is out and in use to the fireproof safe
2.   lock and check all safes are secure
3.   leave by the nearest exit in accordance with Fire Evacuation procedures
 
 
##Post action to emergency evacuation and invacuation
If there has been any damage to any of the encryption stored at the MoJ:

*   notify CESG immediately on 01242 221491 extension 31950 notifying them of the event and request an immediate record of holdings list
*   a CINRAS report must be generated and issued to cinras@cesg.gsi.gov.uk and a copy to OperationalSecurityTeam@justice.gsi.gov.uk
*   a muster of all key variables and a check against the record of holding list undertaken and an order to CESG raised of any replacement key variables
*   upon receipt of a replacement key variable emergency plans to change the key variable of the associated product must begin
